      <p><mark class= "selectionr"> Something Rotten is mainly meant to be comedic. While it does succeed in being funny, it also addresses in a weighty (albeit satricially critical) message about fame and what we do to achieve it. </p>
        
      <p><mark class= "selectionr"> One of the two main characters, Nick Bottom, is determined to outdo Shakespare by writing the mostt well-renowned play ever. Unfortunately against his brother Nigel's advice, he attempts to achieve this through deceitful means. </p>
        
      <p><mark class= "selectionr"> The story teaches us that there is no succes or honor in glory that is gained through dishonest practices. Being truthful, not onlt to others but to yourself, is the most important thing regardless of your goal. Being someone who is true to their heart is more important than being someone famous.</p>
