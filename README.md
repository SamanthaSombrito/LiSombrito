<b><h1>HISTORICAL MUSICALS AND THEIR RELEVANCY</b></h1> </br></br>
	<p> History and Musical Theatre, in the modern era, are often regarded as things of the past. Relics of what once was. As such they aren’t paid much mainstream attention to in the contemporary world, especially with the ever-looming presence of the internet. This website is made to analyze the themes and subjects of historical musicals so we can prove that they still tie into our daily lives. Even going so far as to offer important life lessons and concepts that are still very relevant today. </p>
